# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository covers the basics of requirement analysis ‚Äî the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting software needs. It includes key concepts, techniques, and examples useful for developers, analysts, and students.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.


### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

#### 1. **Requirement Gathering** üóÇÔ∏è

- **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Collect input from a broader audience.
- **Workshops:** Host interactive sessions with stakeholders.
- **Observation:** Observe end-users in their real environment.
- **Document Analysis:** Review existing systems and documentation.

#### 2. **Requirement Elicitation** ‚úçÔ∏è

- **Brainstorming:** Generate ideas collaboratively.
- **Focus Groups:** Discuss needs in small stakeholder groups.
- **Prototyping:** Build mockups to clarify and refine requirements.

#### 3. **Requirement Documentation** üìö

- **Requirement Specification Document:** A detailed list of all requirements.
- **User Stories:** Describe features from the user's point of view.
- **Use Cases:** Visualize user-system interactions.

#### 4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** üìä

- **Requirement Prioritization:** Rank requirements by importance.
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Check if requirements are doable within constraints.
- **Modeling:** Use diagrams (e.g., DFDs, ERDs) to represent requirements.

#### 5. **Requirement Validation** ‚úÖ

- **Review and Approval:** Ensure requirements are accurate and complete.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Define standards for requirement satisfaction.
- **Traceability:** Use matrices to track requirements through development.
